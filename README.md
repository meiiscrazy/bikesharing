This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Analysis
- The population between Des Moines, IA and New York, NY is extremely different. The population for Des Moines, IA is 204,220 while New York, NY is 19,378,144
- The total recorded number of people using Citi bikes in New York is 2,344,224
- Around 10% of New York's population uses Citi bikes, and each rider bikes around 15-30 minutes per trip
- New Yorkers prefer to ride Citi bikes without subscribing to the service, it is a convenient mode of transportation in a densely populated city

## Conclusion
Because there is such a big population difference between both cities, I do not believe that implementing Citi Bikes in Des Moines, IA will be a success. Out of the 19 million people in New York there are 2 million users which is 10% of the population. The average trip duration for each user also varies because New York is geogrpahically larger people spend more time getting from point A to point B. There is definitely a possibility that Citi Bikes would be successful in Des Moines, IA but I would not recommend implementing it based on the population difference.
