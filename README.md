# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Analysis
### What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

- The population between Des Moines, IA and New York, NY is extremely different. The population for Des Moines, IA is 204,220 while New York, NY is 19,378,144
- The total recorded number of people using Citi bikes in New York is 2,344,224
- New York Subscribers vs Customers page shows that people prefer to ride Citi bikes while subscribing to the service, it is a convenient mode of transportation in a densely populated city
- Around 10% of New York's population uses Citi bikes, and each rider bikes around 15-30 minutes per trip
- Using weather data we can see that in 2019 the weather between both states are similar
- Taking the nice weather into account, if Citi bikes were implemented we can see similar peak hours like we see in New York. The peak hours for August 2019 is 5pm-7pm  
- From external research, we find that Des Moines already has its own biking services that provide a subscription service
- Looking at the bike station comparison, we see that New York has hundreds of bike stations placed around the city while Des Moines has around 20 bike stations placed around the city

## Conclusion
Because there is such a big population difference between both cities, I do not believe that implementing Citi Bikes in Des Moines, IA will be a success. Out of the 19 million people in New York there are 2 million users which is 10% of the population. The average trip duration for each user also varies because New York is geogrpahically larger and there are hundreds of bike stations compared to the 20 Des Moines has. We can assume that if Citi Bikes were implemented in Des Moines the average trip duration would be less because of the limited number of bike stations and city size. Des Moines already implemented its own bike system around the city so there is no need to implement Citi Bikes in Des Moines. Des Moines seems like a very beautiful place and ready to accept tourists and visitors but as investors, Citi Bikes should not implement its bike service in Des Moines.
