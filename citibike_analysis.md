This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Analysis
### What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

According to the Census Bureau the population between Des Moines, IA and New York, NY is extremely different. The population for Des Moines, IA is 204,220 while New York, NY is 19,378,144.

Out of 19 million people in New York the total recorded number of people using Citi Bikes is 2,344,224 which is around 10% of the entire population. Surprisingly 51 year olds are riding these bikes the most but 24 year olds are riding these bikes the longest.

Now lets take a look between Subscribers and Customers. Looking at the graph people prefer to ride Citi Bikes while subscribing to the service, this proves what a convenient and cost efficient mode of transportation Citi Bikes are.

Looking at weather data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental we see that in August 2019 the weather between both states are similar. Take a look at the August peak riding time for New York, it's showing peak hours between 5-7pm. It's possible with similar weather Des Moines could also see similar peak riding times.

According to https://www.catchdesmoines.com/ Des Moines already has its own biking services that provide a subscription service

Taking the bike station data from B-Cycle we see that Des Moines has around 20 bike stations placed around the city while New York has hundreds of bike stations in comparison.

## Conclusion
Because there is such a big population difference between both cities, I do not believe that implementing Citi Bikes in Des Moines, IA will be a success. Out of the 19 million people in New York there are 2 million users which is 10% of the population. The average trip duration for each user also varies because New York is geogrpahically larger and there are hundreds of bike stations compared to the 20 Des Moines has. We can assume that if Citi Bikes were implemented in Des Moines the average trip duration would be less because of the limited number of bike stations and city size. Des Moines already implemented its own bike system around the city so there is no need to implement Citi Bikes in Des Moines. Des Moines seems like a very beautiful place and ready to accept tourists and visitors but as investors, Citi Bikes should not implement its bike service in Des Moines.
